sentence=A painless way to setup a mesh with ESP8266 and ESP32 devices
paragraph=painlessMesh is a user-friendly library for creating mesh networks with ESP8266 and ESP32 devices. It handles routing and network management automatically, so you can focus on your application. The library uses JSON-based messaging and syncs time across all nodes, making it ideal for coordinated behaviour like synchronized light displays or sensor networks reporting to a central node.
